    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>This molasses-dark, ginger-and-spice flavored cookie is perfect for gingerbread men. We roll it a bit thicker
        than usual, to give the cookies just a hint of chew. While ginger is often thought of as a winter baking flavor,
        we've found that ginger pairs well with various fruits, too. Ginger and peach is an especially wonderful
        combination; try gingerbread cookies served with fresh sliced peaches, or a peach crumble topped with
        gingerbread crumbs.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 6 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon ground ginger </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground cloves </li>
        <li> 1 cup shortening, melted and cooled slightly </li>
        <li> 1 cup molasses </li>
        <li> 1 cup packed brown sugar </li>
        <li> Â½ cup water </li>
        <li> 1 egg </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon; set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>In a medium bowl, mix together the shortening, molasses, brown sugar, water, egg, and vanilla until
                smooth. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients, until they are completely absorbed. Divide dough into 3
                pieces, pat down to 1 1/2 inch thickness, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4
                inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto an
                ungreased cookie sheet.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
            <p>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. When the cookies are done, they will look dry, but still
                be soft to the touch. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks. When cool, the cookies can be
                frosted with the icing of your choice.
